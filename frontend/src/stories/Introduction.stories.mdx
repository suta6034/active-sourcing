# Storybook - Team MATCHA
In order to run the storybook, you should switch to a higher node version (at least node 16), otherwise a typeerror will appear.<br/>
This Storybook should be used, for displaying, testing and developing the components which we create.
In order to run the storybook type `npm run storybook` in the command line. After that, a browser window should open where you can
view all components and the written documentation.<br/>

## Viewing already existing stories
On the left side of the launched storybook, you can find the tree. Inside the tree are different folders which hold so
called <i>stories</i>. Each story should be designed for a specific component. A story of a component represents the component
with a specific predefined configuration. In the bottom of the page are all properties listed which can be modified in order to
change the appeareance and the behaviour of the component.

## Writing a story
In order to write a story for a component, a file with the naming `[ComponentName].stories.ts` has to be created. Inside this file,
the types <i>Meta</i> and <i>Story</i> have to be imported from the package `'@storybook/vue3'`.<br/>
After the types are imported, a Meta has to be defined and exported as shown below:

```typescript
export default {
    title: '[PATH]/[COMPONENT_NAME]',
    component: [COMPONENT_NAME],
    argTypes: {
        [OBJECT TO DEFINE TYPES OF PROPERTIES]
    },
} as Meta;
```

After defining the <i>Meta</i>-part, a template for the stories is defined:
```typescript
const Template: Story = (args) => ({
    components: { [COMPONENT_NAME] },
    setup() {
        return { args };
    },
    template: `<[COMPONENT_NAME] v-bind="args">[CONTENT FOR SLOT (optional)]</[COMPONENT_NAME]>`,
});
```

Now stories can be defined by binding to the template and defining the arguments which are then handed to the
component.

```typescript
...

export const STORY1 = Template.bind({});
STORY1.args = {
    prop1: [value],
    prop2: [value],
    prop3: [value],
    prop4: [value],
};

export const STORY2 = Template.bind({});
STORY2.args = {
    prop1: [value],
    prop2: [value],
    prop3: [value],
    prop4: [value],
};

...
```

When the storybook is launched, the defined stories are parsed and then displayed inside the tree. They don't have to be
added somewhere else in order to view or edit them inside the launched storybook.

## Writing documentation
The storybook is not only useful for working with the built components, it can also be used for writing documentation.<br/>
Documentation can be written inside of <i>[DOCUMENTATION_NAME].stories.mdx</i> files.<br/>
Every documentation file should start by importing `Meta` and creating the title with it:
```mdx
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

<Meta title="PATH/DOCUMENTATION_NAME" />
```
After defining the title the documentation can be written using markdown language and html syntax.
